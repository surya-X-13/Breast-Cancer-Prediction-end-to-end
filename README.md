# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-end-to-end
This project focuses on building and evaluating various machine learning models for the early diagnosis of breast cancer using the Diagnostic Breast Cancer Dataset. The primary goal is to accurately classify tumors as either Benign or Malignant, with a strong emphasis on minimizing False Negatives due to the critical nature of the medical app.
